You can use simple img tags for the icons, find cool icons at: http://iconfinder.com/ (prefer SVG-s since they are resolution
 independent)
Or use https://fontawesome.com
When adding a new todo, remember you have to add the buttons too. This means you have to set up the click handling there as well.
You can solve this with the help of creating id-s for the todos and the buttons like (todo-1, button-1)
But you can set up the click handling for any completing or deleting button in general
In this case you can set up handling the clicks for the container element of the todos (eg. .todos-container)
And specify what you're interested in with another selector (eg. .delete-button)
With this general approach you'll need to know which one button was clicked and inside a click handler you can tell that by 
using $(event.target) (where event is the input of the function):
*/

let a = 1,
todoId = [];

$('#add-btn').click(() =>{
var textInput = $('#new-todo').val();
$('ul').append(`<li id=${a++}>${textInput}</li>`);
todoId.push(a)
$('li:last-child').click((event) => {
$(event.target).toggleClass('completed')});
});
